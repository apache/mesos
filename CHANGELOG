Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.14.0
--------------------------------------
* The primary feature in this release is "Slave Recovery" which allows
  restarted slaves (e.g., deploys, crashes) to reconnect with old live
  executors/tasks. To enable slave recovery:
  * First you need to enable checkpointing on slaves with "--checkpoint" flag.
  * Frameworks can opt in to this feature by setting "FrameworkInfo.checkpoint"
    when registering with the master.
  * Once a Framework opts in, a restarted slave will recover all the framework's
    tasks and executors. The tasks/executors stay alive through a slave
    restart and reconnect with the restarted slave.
  * Slave recovery also improves the reliability of delivering status updates.

* The release also includes a new feature called "Resource Reservations" which
  allows reserving resources on a slave to particular roles (This is an
  experimental feature).

* This release also includes a new Mesos plugin for Jenkins which allows Jenkins
  to dynamically launch Jenkins slaves on a Mesos cluster (This is an
  experimental feature).

* There are also several bug fixes and stability improvements.

** Sub-task
    * [MESOS-548] - Upgrade angular.js to use the full angular-ui.js
    * [MESOS-549] - Change truncated IDs to show on hover
    * [MESOS-630] - Improve the performance of Master::Http::stats().

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.12.1
--------------------------------------
* This release is primarily a bug fix release with a few small features for running JVM frameworks, like Hadoop and Jenkins.

** Bug
    * [MESOS-515] - Slave fails to detect free disk space
    * [MESOS-524] - JVM tests are flaky on OSX.
    * [MESOS-587] - MesosNativeLibrary.java doesn't read environment variable "MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY".

    * [MESOS-604] - Slave should use the filesystem containing the work directory for disk usage calculation
    * [MESOS-605] - Fix wrong compression for hadoop package

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.12.0
--------------------------------------
* This release includes bug fixes and stability improvements.
* The primary feature in this release is executor resource consumption monitoring. Slaves now monitor resource consumption of running executors and expose it over JSON and through the webui.
* This release also includes a new and improved Hadoop framework. The new port doesn't require patching Hadoop (i.e., it's a self contained Hadoop contrib) and lets you use existing schedulers (e.g., the fair scheduler or capacity scheduler)! The tradeoff, however, is that it doesn't take as much advantage of the fine-grained nature of a Mesos task (i.e., there is no longer a 1-1 mapping between a Mesos task and a map/reduce task).

** Sub-task
    * [MESOS-214] - Report resources being used by executors
    * [MESOS-419] - Old slave directories should not be garbage collected based on file modification time

    * [MESOS-152] - Slave should forward status updates for unknown tasks
    * [MESOS-285] - configure.macosx checks for version "10.7" but should check for 10.7 or greater
    * [MESOS-307] - Web UI file download links are broken.
    * [MESOS-317] - python mesos core bindings rejects framework messages with null bytes
    * [MESOS-319] - Fix buggy read / write calls.
    * [MESOS-325] - make clean is broken
    * [MESOS-332] - Executor launcher fetches resources as slave user, instead of executor user.
    * [MESOS-340] - Gperftools target always rebuilds.
    * [MESOS-374] - HTTP GET requests to /statistics/snapshot.json crash the slave
    * [MESOS-422] - Master leader election should be more robust to stale ephemeral nodes
    * [MESOS-486] - TaskInfo should include a 'source' in order to enable getting resource monitoring statistics.

** Improvement
    * [MESOS-293] - Make clean deletes checked in files.

** New Feature
    * [MESOS-99] - display slave resource usage information in the slave webui

** Task
    * [MESOS-274] - Unicode / Binary files over http endpoints.
    * [MESOS-324] - Monitor executor resource usage.
    * [MESOS-331] - Add --disable-perftools to configure.
