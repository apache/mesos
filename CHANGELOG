Release Notes - Mesos - Version 1.0.0
--------------------------------------------
This release contains the following new features:

  * Scheduler and Executor v1 HTTP APIs are now considered stable.

  * [MESOS-4791] - **Experimental** support for v1 Master and Agent APIs. These
    APIs let operators and services (monitoring, load balancers) send HTTP
    requests to '/api/v1' endpoint on master or agent. See
    `docs/operator-http-api.md` for details.

  * [MESOS-4828] - **Experimental** support for a new `disk/xfs' isolator
    has been added to isolate disk resources more efficiently. Please refer to
    docs/mesos-containerizer.md for more details.

  * [MESOS-4355] - **Experimental** support for Docker volume plugin. We added a
    new isolator 'docker/volume' which allows users to use external volumes in
    Mesos containerizer. Currently, the isolator interacts with the Docker
    volume plugins using a tool called 'dvdcli'. By speaking the Docker volume
    plugin API, most of the Docker volume plugins are supported.

  * [MESOS-4641] - **Experimental** A new network isolator, the
    `network/cni` isolator, has been introduced in the `MesosContainerizer`. The
    `network/cni` isolator implements the Container Network Interface (CNI)
    specification proposed by CoreOS.  With CNI the `network/cni` isolator is
    able to allocate a network namespace to Mesos containers and attach the
    container to different types of IP networks by invoking network drivers
    called CNI plugins.

  * [MESOS-2948, MESOS-5403] - The authorizer interface has been refactored in
    order to decouple the ACLs definition language from the interface.
    It additionally includes the option of retrieving `ObjectApprover`. An
    `ObjectApprover` can be used to synchronously check authorizations for a
    given object and is hence useful when authorizing a large number of objects
    and/or large objects (which need to be copied using request based
    authorization). NOTE: This is a **breaking change** for authorizer modules.

  * [MESOS-5405] - The `subject` and `object` fields in authorization::Request
    have been changed from required to optional. If either of these fields is
    not set, the request should only be authorized if any subject/object should
    be allowed.
    NOTE: This is a semantic change for authorizer modules.

  * [MESOS-4931, MESOS-5709, MESOS-5704] - Authorization based HTTP endpoint
    filtering enables operators to restrict what part of the cluster state a
    user is authorized to see.
    Consider for example the `/state` master endpoint: an operator can now
    authorize users to only see a subset of the running frameworks, tasks, or
    executors. The following endpoints support HTTP endpoint filtering:
    '/state', '/state-summary', '/tasks', '/frameworks','/weights',
    and '/roles'. Additonally the following v1 API calls support filtering:
    'GET_ROLES','GET_WEIGHTS','GET_FRAMEWORKS', 'GET_STATE', and 'GET_TASKS'.

  * [MESOS-4909] - Tasks can now specify a kill policy. They are best-effort,
    because machine failures or forcible terminations may occur. Currently, the
    only available kill policy is how long to wait between graceful and forcible
    task kill. In the future, more policies may be available (e.g. hitting an
    HTTP endpoint, running a command, etc). Note that it is the executor's
    responsibility to enforce kill policies. For executor-less command-based
    tasks, the kill is performed via sending a signal to the task process:
    SIGTERM for the graceful kill and SIGKILL for the forcible kill. For docker
    executor-less tasks the grace period is passed to 'docker stop --time'. This
    feature supersedes the '--docker_stop_timeout', which is now deprecated.

  * [MESOS-4908] - The task kill policy defined within 'TaskInfo' can now be
    overridden when the scheduler kills the task. This can be used by schedulers
    to forcefully kill a task which is already being killed, e.g. if something
    went wrong during a graceful kill and a forcible kill is desired. Note that
    it is the executor's responsibility to honor the 'Event.kill.kill_policy'
    field and override the task's kill policy and kill policy from a previous
    kill task request. To use this feature, schedulers and executors must
    support HTTP API; use the '--http_command_executor' agent flag to ensure
    the agent launches the HTTP API based command executor.

  * [MESOS-4949] - The executor shutdown grace period can now be configured in
    `ExecutorInfo`, which overrides the agent flag. When shutting down an
    executor the agent will wait in a best-effort manner for the grace period
    specified here before forcibly destroying the container. The executor must
    not assume that it will always be allotted the full grace period, as the
    agent may decide to allot a shorter period and failures / forcible
    terminations may occur. Together with kill policies this gives frameworks
    flexibility around how to clean up tasks and executors.

  * [MESOS-3094] - **Experimental** support for launching mesos tasks on
    Windows. Note that there are no isolation guarantees provided yet.

  * [MESOS-4090] - The `mesos.native` python module has been split into two,
    `mesos.executor` and `mesos.scheduler`. This change also removes
    un-necessary 3rd party dependencies from `mesos.executor` and
    `mesos.scheduler`. `mesos.native` still exists, combining both modules for
    backwards compatibility with existing code.

  * [MESOS-1478] - Phase I of the Slave to Agent rename is complete. To support
    the rename, new duplicate flags (e.g., --agent_reregister_timeout), new
    binaries (e.g., mesos-agent) and WebUI sandbox links have been added. All
    the logging output has been updated to use the term 'agent' now. Flags,
    binaries and scripts with 'slave' keyword have been deprecated (see
    "Deprecations section below").

  * [MESOS-4312] - **Experimental** support for building and running mesos on
    IBM PowerPC platform.

  * [MESOS-4189] - Weights for resource roles can now be configured dynamically
    via the new '/weights' endpoint on the master.

  * [MESOS-4424] - Support for using Nvidia GPUs as a resource in the
    Mesos "unified" containerizer. This support includes running containers
    with and without filesystem isolation (i.e. running both imageless
    containers as well as containers using a docker image). Frameworks must
    opt-in to receiving GPU resources via the GPU_RESOURCES framework
    capability (see the scarce resource problem in MESOS-5377). We support
    'nvidia-docker'-style docker containers by injecting a volume that
    contains the Nvidia libraries / binaries when the docker image has
    the 'com.nvidia.volumes.needed' label. Support for the docker
    containerizer will come in a future release.

  * [MESOS-5724] - SSL certificate validation allows for additional IP address
    subject alternative name extension verification.

Deprecations:
  * [MESOS-2281] - Deprecated the plain text format for credentials in favor of
    the JSON format.

  * [MESOS-4910] - Deprecate the --docker_stop_timeout agent flag.

  * [MESOS-5001] - The 'allocator/event_queue_dispatches' metric is now
    deprecated in favor 'of allocator/mesos/event_queue_dispatches'.

  * [MESOS-5029] - Deprecated the ExecutorInfo.source field in favor of
    ExecutorInfo.labels.

  * [MESOS-3781] - Deprecated flags with keyword 'slave' in favor of 'agent'.

  * [MESOS-3779] - Deprecated sandbox links with 'slave' keyword in the WebUI.

  * [MESOS-3784] - Deprecated `slave` subcommand for mesos-cli.

  * [MESOS-5155] - Deprecated `SetQuota` and `RemoveQuota` ACLs. This change is
    applicable to the local authorizer as well as any custom authorizer module.

  * [MESOS-5666] - Deprecated camel cased `taskInfo` and `executorInfo` in
    isolator `ContainerConfig`.

Additional API Changes:
  * [MESOS-4580] - Returning `202` (Accepted) for /reserve and related endpoints.

  * [MESOS-4735] - Added 'output_file' field to CommandInfo.URI in Scheduler API
    and v1 Scheduler HTTP API.

  * [MESOS-5014] - Changed Call and Event Type enums in scheduler.proto
    from required to optional for the purpose of backwards compatibility.

  * [MESOS-5015] - Changed Call and Event Type enums in executor.proto
    from required to optional for the purpose of backwards compatibility.

  * [MESOS-5029] - Added 'labels' to ExecutorInfo.

  * [MESOS-5030] - Added non-terminal task metadata to the container resource
    usage information.

  * [MESOS-5408] - Deleted the /observe HTTP endpoint.

  * [MESOS-4843, MESOS-5150, MESOS-5286, MESOS-5335, MESOS-5336] - Authorization
    has been added to the '/metrics/snapshot', '/logging/toggle', '/quota',
    '/files/browse', '/files/download', '/files/read', '/flags', and
    '/containers' endpoints. If a Mesos cluster has authorization enabled, these
    endpoints now require that ACLs be set to authorize principals to access
    them. Note that the '/metrics/snapshot' and '/files/*' endpoints are used by
    the web UI, and thus using the web UI in a cluster with authorization
    enabled will require that ACLs be set appropriately.

  * [MESOS-5064] - Remove default value for the agent `work_dir`. This flag is
    now required, and the agent will exit immediately if it is not provided.

  * [MESOS-5637] - Authorized endpoints consistently return `503` (Service
    Unavailable) instead of `500` (Internal Server Error) when the authenticator
    or the authorizer fails to process the request.

  * [MESOS-5657] - Executors should not inherit environment variables from the
    agent.

  * [MESOS-5680] - We should not 'chown -R' on persistent volumes every time
    container tries to use it.

  * [MESOS-5642] - Namespace and header file of `Allocator` has been moved to
    be consistent with other packages.

  * [MESOS-4805] - Upgraded vendored ry-http-parser-1c3624a to nodejs/http-parser 2.6.1.
  * [MESOS-4678] - Upgraded vendored protobuf 2.5.0 to 2.6.1.

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.28.0
--------------------------------------
This release contains the following new features:
  * [MESOS-4343] - A new cgroups isolator for enabling the net_cls subsystem in
    Linux. The cgroups/net_cls isolator allows operators to provide network
    performance isolation and network segmentation for containers within a Mesos
    cluster. To enable the cgroups/net_cls isolator, append `cgroups/net_cls` to
    the `--isolation` flag when starting the slave. Please refer to
    docs/mesos-containerizer.md for more details.

  * [MESOS-4687] - The implementation of scalar resource values (e.g., "2.5
    CPUs") has changed. Mesos now reliably supports resources with up to three
    decimal digits of precision (e.g., "2.501 CPUs"); resources with more than
    three decimal digits of precision will be rounded. Internally, resource math
    is now done using a fixed-point format that supports three decimal digits of
    precision, and then converted to/from floating point for input and output,
    respectively. Frameworks that do their own resource math and manipulate
    fractional resources may observe differences in roundoff error and numerical
    precision.

  * [MESOS-4479] - Reserved resources can now optionally include "labels".
    Labels are a set of key-value pairs that can be used to associate metadata
    with a reserved resource. For example, frameworks can use this feature to
    distinguish between two reservations for the same role at the same agent
    that are intended for different purposes.

  * [MESOS-2840] - **Experimental** support for container images in Mesos
    containerizer (a.k.a. Unified Containerizer). This allows frameworks to
    launch Docker/Appc containers using Mesos containerizer without relying on
    docker daemon (engine) or rkt. The isolation of the containers is done using
    isolators. Please refer to docs/container-image.md for currently supported
    features and limitations.

  * [MESOS-4793] - **Experimental** support for v1 Executor HTTP API. This
    allows executors to send HTTP requests to the /api/v1/executor agent
    endpoint without the need for an executor driver. Please refer to
    docs/executor-http-api.md for more details.

  * [MESOS-4370] Added support for service discovery of Docker containers that
    use Docker Remote API v1.21.

Additional API Changes:
  * [MESOS-4066] - Agent should not return partial state when a request is made
    to /state endpoint during recovery.

  * [MESOS-4547] - Introduce TASK_KILLING state.

  * [MESOS-4712] - Remove 'force' field from the Subscribe Call in v1
    Scheduler API.

  * [MESOS-4591] - Change the object of ReserveResources and CreateVolume ACLs
    to `roles`.

  * [MESOS-3583] - Add stream IDs for HTTP schedulers.

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.20.0
--------------------------------------
This release includes a lot of new cool features. The major new features are
listed below:

* Docker support in Mesos:
  * Users now can launch executors/tasks within Docker containers.
  * Mesos now supports running multiple containerizers simultaneously. The slave
    can dynamically choose a containerizer to launch containers based on the
    configuration of executors/tasks.

* Container level network monitoring for mesos containerizer:
  * Network statistics for each active container can be retrieved through the
    /monitor/statistics.json endpoint on the slave.
  * Completely transparent to the tasks running on the slave. No need to change
    the service discovery mechanism for tasks.

* Framework authorization:
  * Allows frameworks to (re-)register with authorized roles.
  * Allows frameworks to launch tasks/executors as authorized users.
  * Allows authorized principals to shutdown framework(s) through HTTP endpoint.

* Framework rate limiting:
  * In a multi-framework environment, this feature aims to protect the
    throughput of high-SLA (e.g., production, service) frameworks by having the
    master throttle messages from other (e.g., development, batch) frameworks.

* Enable building against installed third-party dependencies.

API Changes:
  * [MESOS-857] - The Python API now uses different namespacing. This will break
    existing schedulers, please refer to the upgrades document.

  * [MESOS-1409] - Status update acknowledgements are sent through the Master
    now. This only affects you if you're using a non-Mesos binding (e.g. pure
    language binding), in which case refer to the upgrades document.

HTTP endpoint changes:
  * [MESOS-1188] - "deactivated_slaves" represents inactive slaves in

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.19.1
--------------------------------------
* This is a bug fix release.

All Issues:
** Bug
  * [MESOS-1448] - Mesos Fetcher doesn't support URLs that have 30X redirects.
  * [MESOS-1534] - Scheduler process is not explicitly terminated in the destructor of MesosSchedulerDriver.
  * [MESOS-1538] - A container destruction in the middle of a launch leads to CHECK failure.
  * [MESOS-1539] - No longer able to spin up Mesos master in local mode.
  * [MESOS-1550] - MesosSchedulerDriver should never, ever, call 'stop'.
  * [MESOS-1551] - Master does not create work directory when missing.


Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.19.0
--------------------------------------
* The primary feature of this release is the "Registrar". This is the addition
  of replicated state in the master to ensure the set of slaves in the cluster
  remains consistent in the presence of master failovers.
  * This feature is currently used in a write-only manner by default to allow
    smooth upgrades. 0.20.0 by default will be write *and* read.
  * Operators must now specify the 'work_dir' for the master, along with the
    'quorum' size of the ensemble of masters.
  * This means adding or removing masters must be done carefully! The best
    practice is to only ever add or remove a single master at a time and to
    allow a small amount of time for the replicated log to catch up on the new
    master.

* Authentication support has been added for slaves.

* Metrics reporting has been overhauled and is now exposed on /metrics/snapshot.

* Support for external containerization strategies has been added to support
  custom container needs as well as experimentation; this is an alpha release!

* There are also several bug fixes and stability improvements.

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.14.0
--------------------------------------
* The primary feature in this release is "Slave Recovery" which allows
  restarted slaves (e.g., deploys, crashes) to reconnect with old live
  executors/tasks. To enable slave recovery:
  * First you need to enable checkpointing on slaves with "--checkpoint" flag.
  * Frameworks can opt in to this feature by setting "FrameworkInfo.checkpoint"
    when registering with the master.
  * Once a Framework opts in, a restarted slave will recover all the framework's
    tasks and executors. The tasks/executors stay alive through a slave
    restart and reconnect with the restarted slave.
  * Slave recovery also improves the reliability of delivering status updates.

* The release also includes a new feature called "Resource Reservations" which
  allows reserving resources on a slave to particular roles (This is an
  experimental feature).

* This release also includes a new Mesos plugin for Jenkins which allows Jenkins
  to dynamically launch Jenkins slaves on a Mesos cluster (This is an
  experimental feature).

There are also several bug fixes and stability improvements.

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.12.1
--------------------------------------
* This release is primarily a bug fix release with a few small features for running JVM frameworks, like Hadoop and Jenkins.

All Issues:
** Bug
  * [MESOS-515] - Slave fails to detect free disk space
  * [MESOS-524] - JVM tests are flaky on OSX.
  * [MESOS-587] - MesosNativeLibrary.java doesn't read environment variable "MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY".
  * [MESOS-597] - Set MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY or (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH before launching an executor in order to enable JVM based executors to easily find libmesos.so.
  * [MESOS-599] - Make sure stderr/stdout get launcher output.
  * [MESOS-604] - Slave should use the filesystem containing the work directory for disk usage calculation
  * [MESOS-605] - Fix wrong compression for hadoop package

** Improvement
  * [MESOS-179] - Need to check for Python development headers
  * [MESOS-346] - Improve OSX configure output when deprecated headers are present.
  * [MESOS-360] - Mesos jar should be built for java 6
  * [MESOS-602] - Allow Mesos native library to be loaded from an absolute path

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.12.0
--------------------------------------
* This release includes bug fixes and stability improvements.
* The primary feature in this release is executor resource consumption monitoring. Slaves now monitor resource consumption of running executors and expose it over JSON and through the webui.
* This release also includes a new and improved Hadoop framework. The new port doesn't require patching Hadoop (i.e., it's a self contained Hadoop contrib) and lets you use existing schedulers (e.g., the fair scheduler or capacity scheduler)! The tradeoff, however, is that it doesn't take as much advantage of the fine-grained nature of a Mesos task (i.e., there is no longer a 1-1 mapping between a Mesos task and a map/reduce task).

All Issues:
** Sub-task
  * [MESOS-214] - Report resources being used by executors
  * [MESOS-419] - Old slave directories should not be garbage collected based on file modification time

** Bug
  * [MESOS-107] - Scheduler library should not acknowledge a status update if the driver has been aborted.
  * [MESOS-152] - Slave should forward status updates for unknown tasks
  * [MESOS-285] - configure.macosx checks for version "10.7" but should check for 10.7 or greater
  * [MESOS-307] - Web UI file download links are broken.
  * [MESOS-317] - python mesos core bindings rejects framework messages with null bytes
  * [MESOS-319] - Fix buggy read / write calls.
  * [MESOS-325] - make clean is broken
  * [MESOS-332] - Executor launcher fetches resources as slave user, instead of executor user.
  * [MESOS-340] - Gperftools target always rebuilds.
  * [MESOS-374] - HTTP GET requests to /statistics/snapshot.json crash the slave
  * [MESOS-422] - Master leader election should be more robust to stale ephemeral nodes
  * [MESOS-486] - TaskInfo should include a 'source' in order to enable getting resource monitoring statistics.

** Improvement
  * [MESOS-293] - Make clean deletes checked in files.

** New Feature
  * [MESOS-99] - display slave resource usage information in the slave webui

** Task
  * [MESOS-274] - Unicode / Binary files over http endpoints.
  * [MESOS-324] - Monitor executor resource usage.
  * [MESOS-331] - Add --disable-perftools to configure.
