Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.19.0
--------------------------------------
* The primary feature of this release is the "Registrar". This is the addition
  of replicated state in the master to ensure the set of slaves in the cluster
  remains consistent in the presence of master failovers.
  * This feature is currently used in a write-only manner by default to allow
    smooth upgrades. 0.20.0 by default will be write *and* read.
  * Operators must now specify the 'work_dir' for the master, along with the
    'quorum' size of the ensemble of masters.
  * This means adding or removing masters must be done carefully! The best
    practice is to only ever add or remove a single master at a time and to
    allow a small amount of time for the replicated log to catch up on the new
    master.

* Authentication support has been added for slaves.

* Metrics reporting has been overhauled and is now exposed on /metrics/snapshot.

* Support for external containerization strategies has been added to support
  custom container needs as well as experimentation; this is an alpha release!

* There are also several bug fixes and stability improvements.

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.14.0
--------------------------------------
* The primary feature in this release is "Slave Recovery" which allows
  restarted slaves (e.g., deploys, crashes) to reconnect with old live
  executors/tasks. To enable slave recovery:
  * First you need to enable checkpointing on slaves with "--checkpoint" flag.
  * Frameworks can opt in to this feature by setting "FrameworkInfo.checkpoint"
    when registering with the master.
  * Once a Framework opts in, a restarted slave will recover all the framework's
    tasks and executors. The tasks/executors stay alive through a slave
    restart and reconnect with the restarted slave.
  * Slave recovery also improves the reliability of delivering status updates.

* The release also includes a new feature called "Resource Reservations" which
  allows reserving resources on a slave to particular roles (This is an
  experimental feature).

* This release also includes a new Mesos plugin for Jenkins which allows Jenkins
  to dynamically launch Jenkins slaves on a Mesos cluster (This is an
  experimental feature).

* There are also several bug fixes and stability improvements.

** Sub-task
    * [MESOS-548] - Upgrade angular.js to use the full angular-ui.js

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.12.1
--------------------------------------
* This release is primarily a bug fix release with a few small features for running JVM frameworks, like Hadoop and Jenkins.

** Bug
    * [MESOS-515] - Slave fails to detect free disk space
    * [MESOS-524] - JVM tests are flaky on OSX.
    * [MESOS-587] - MesosNativeLibrary.java doesn't read environment variable "MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY".
    * [MESOS-597] - Set MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY or (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH before launching an executor in order to enable JVM based executors to easily find libmesos.so.
    * [MESOS-599] - Make sure stderr/stdout get launcher output.
    * [MESOS-604] - Slave should use the filesystem containing the work directory for disk usage calculation
    * [MESOS-605] - Fix wrong compression for hadoop package

** Improvement
    * [MESOS-179] - Need to check for Python development headers

Release Notes - Mesos - Version 0.12.0
--------------------------------------
* This release includes bug fixes and stability improvements.
* The primary feature in this release is executor resource consumption monitoring. Slaves now monitor resource consumption of running executors and expose it over JSON and through the webui.
* This release also includes a new and improved Hadoop framework. The new port doesn't require patching Hadoop (i.e., it's a self contained Hadoop contrib) and lets you use existing schedulers (e.g., the fair scheduler or capacity scheduler)! The tradeoff, however, is that it doesn't take as much advantage of the fine-grained nature of a Mesos task (i.e., there is no longer a 1-1 mapping between a Mesos task and a map/reduce task).

** Sub-task
    * [MESOS-214] - Report resources being used by executors
    * [MESOS-419] - Old slave directories should not be garbage collected based on file modification time

** Bug
    * [MESOS-107] - Scheduler library should not acknowledge a status update if the driver has been aborted.
    * [MESOS-152] - Slave should forward status updates for unknown tasks
    * [MESOS-285] - configure.macosx checks for version "10.7" but should check for 10.7 or greater
    * [MESOS-307] - Web UI file download links are broken.
    * [MESOS-317] - python mesos core bindings rejects framework messages with null bytes
    * [MESOS-319] - Fix buggy read / write calls.
    * [MESOS-325] - make clean is broken
    * [MESOS-332] - Executor launcher fetches resources as slave user, instead of executor user.
    * [MESOS-340] - Gperftools target always rebuilds.
    * [MESOS-374] - HTTP GET requests to /statistics/snapshot.json crash the slave
    * [MESOS-422] - Master leader election should be more robust to stale ephemeral nodes
    * [MESOS-486] - TaskInfo should include a 'source' in order to enable getting resource monitoring statistics.

** Improvement
    * [MESOS-293] - Make clean deletes checked in files.

** New Feature
    * [MESOS-99] - display slave resource usage information in the slave webui

** Task
    * [MESOS-274] - Unicode / Binary files over http endpoints.
    * [MESOS-324] - Monitor executor resource usage.
    * [MESOS-331] - Add --disable-perftools to configure.
