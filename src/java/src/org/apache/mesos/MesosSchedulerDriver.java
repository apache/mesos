/**
 * Concrete implementation of a SchedulerDriver that connects a
 * Scheduler with a Mesos master. The MesosSchedulerDriver is
 * thread-safe.
 *
 * Note that scheduler failover is supported in Mesos. After a
 * scheduler is registered with Mesos it may failover (to a new
 * process on the same machine or across multiple machines) by
 * creating a new driver with the ID given to it in {@link
 * Scheduler#registered}.
 *
 * The driver is responsible for invoking the Scheduler callbacks as
 * it communicates with the Mesos master.
 *
 * Note that blocking on the MesosSchedulerDriver (e.g., via {@link
 * #join}) doesn't affect the scheduler callbacks in anyway because
 * they are handled by a different thread.
 *
 * See src/examples/java/TestFramework.java for an example of using
 * the MesosSchedulerDriver.
