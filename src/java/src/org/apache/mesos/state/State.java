/**
 * An abstraction of "state" (possibly between multiple distributed
 * components) represented by "variables" (effectively key/value
 * pairs). Variables are versioned such that setting a variable in the
 * state will only succeed if the variable has not changed since last
 * fetched. Varying implementations of state provide varying
 * replicated guarantees.
 *
 * Note that the semantics of 'fetch' and 'store' provide
 * atomicity. That is, you can not store a variable that has changed
 * since you did the last fetch. That is, if a store succeeds then no
 * other writes have been performed on the variable since your fetch.
 *
 * Example:
 * {@code
 *   State state = new ZooKeeperState();
 *   Future<Variable> variable = state.fetch("machines");
 *   Variable machines = variable.get();
 *   machines = machines.mutate(...);
 *   variable = state.store(machines);
 *   machines = variable.get();
 * }
