// This class is responsible for executing the log recover protocol.
// Any time a replica in non-VOTING status starts, we will run this
// protocol. We first broadcast a recover request to all the replicas
// in the network, and then collect recover responses to decide what
// status the local replica should be in next. The details of the
// recover protocol is shown as follows:
//
// A) Broadcast a RecoverRequest to all replicas in the network.
// B) Collect RecoverResponse from each replica
//   B1) If a quorum of replicas are found in VOTING status (no matter
//       what status the local replica is in currently), the local
//       replica will be put in RECOVERING status next.
//   B2) If the local replica is in EMPTY status and all replicas are
//       found in either EMPTY status or STARTING status, the local
//       replica will be put in STARTING status next.
//   B3) If the local replica is in STARTING status and all replicas
//       are found in either STARTING status or VOTING status, the
//       local replica will be put in VOTING status next.
//   B4) Otherwise, goto (A).
//
//   (B2 and B3 are used to do the two-phase auto initialization.)
//
// We re-use RecoverResponse to specify the return value. The 'status'
// field specifies the next status of the local replica. If the next
// status is RECOVERING, we set the fields 'begin' and 'end' to be the
// lowest begin and highest end position seen in these responses.

// the status of the local replica to VOTING and terminate the
// process, indicating the recovery has completed. If all replicas are
// in EMPTY status and auto-initialization is enabled, a two-phase
// protocol will be used to bootstrap the replicated log.
//
// Here, we list a few scenarios and show how the recover process will
// respond in those scenarios. All the examples assume a quorum size
// of 2. Remember that a new replica is always put in EMPTY status
// initially.
//
// 1) Replica A, B and C are all in VOTING status. The operator adds
//    replica D. In that case, D will go into RECOVERING status and
//    then go into VOTING status. Therefore, we should avoid adding a
//    new replica unless we know that one replica has been removed.
//
// 2) Replica A and B are in VOTING status. The operator adds replica
//    C. In that case, C will go into RECOVERING status and then go
//    into VOTING status, which is expected.
//
// 3) Replica A is in VOTING status. The operator adds replica B. In
//    that case, B will stay in EMPTY status forever. This is expected
//    because we cannot make progress if VOTING replicas are not
//    enough (i.e., less than quorum).
//
// 4) Replica A is in VOTING status and B is in EMPTY status. The
//    operator adds replica C. In that case, C will stay in EMPTY
//    status forever similar to case 3).
//
// 5) Replica A, B and C are all in EMPTY status. Depending on whether
//    auto-initialization is enabled or not, the replicas will behave
//    differently. If auto-initialization is enabled, all replicas
//    will first go into STARTING status. Once *all* replicas have
//    transitioned out of EMPTY status, the replicas will go into
//    VOTING status. If auto-initialization is disabled, all replicas
//    will remain in EMPTY status.
