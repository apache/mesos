The countdown until [#MesosCon](http://www.mesoscon.org) 2015 in Seattle continues: only 38 days until the event!  [Register today](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon/attend/register)!

We're pleased to announce several pre-conference and social activities that we hope will make this year’s conference even more enjoyable.

## MesosCon Hackathon, Wednesday August 19th

Join us for a [pre-conference hackathon on Wednesday, August 19th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mesoscon-2015-pre-conference-hackathon-tickets-17752101012); space is limited so be sure to register today! The hackathon is sponsored by [SignalFx](https://signalfx.com), and hosted by [Moz](http://www.moz.com) at their office in downtown Seattle a short distance from the Sheraton Seattle conference hotel. The hackathon will take place from 8:30-5:00pm.

What should you work on? It's really up to you, as long as it's Mesos-related. Here are a few broad categories of projects to consider.

 * Frameworks (build your own Mesos framework or add features to an existing framework)
 * Mesos Core (squashing bugs, adding new features, or even proposing a design document)
 * Ops (tools to make it easier to operate a Mesos cluster; examples may include monitoring, logging, etc)

Additional details about the hackathon are available on the [Eventbrite registration page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mesoscon-2015-pre-conference-hackathon-tickets-17752101012).

## Attendee Offsite Reception, Thursday Evening, August 20th

Open to all #MesosCon attendees, join us at the [Experience Music Project](http://www.empmuseum.org/) (EMP), a leading-edge nonprofit museum, dedicated to the ideas and risk-taking that fuel contemporary popular culture. Appetizers and drinks included as well as the opportunity to check out some of the current exhibits. Shuttles will be provided from the Sheraton to the EMP starting at 7:30pm and returning later in the evening.

## Mesos Evening Event, Wednesday, August 19th
