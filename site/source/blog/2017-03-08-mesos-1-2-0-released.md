The latest Mesos release, 1.2.0, is now available for [download](/downloads). This release includes the following features and improvements:

  * [MESOS-5931](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5931) -
     **Experimental** support for auto backend in Mesos Containerizer,
    prefering overlayfs then aufs. Please note that the bind backend needs to be
    specified explicitly through the agent flag `--image_provisioner_backend`
    since it requires the sandbox already existed.

  * [MESOS-6402](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6402) -
    **Experimental** support for rlimit in Mesos containerizer.
    The isolator adds support for setting POSIX resource limits (rlimits) for
    containers launched using the Mesos containerizer. POSIX rlimits can be used
    to control the resources a process can consume. See
    [docs](/documentation/latest/posix_rlimits) for details.

  * [MESOS-6419](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6419) -
    **Experimental**: Teardown unregistered frameworks. The master
    now treats recovered frameworks very similarly to frameworks that are registered
    but currently disconnected. For example, recovered frameworks will be reported
    via the normal "frameworks" key when querying HTTP endpoints. This means there
    is no longer a concept of "orphan tasks": if the master knows about a task, the
    task will be running under a framework. Similarly, "teardown" operations on
    recovered frameworks will now work correctly.

  * [MESOS-6460](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6460) -
    **Experimental**: Container Attach and Exec. This feature adds new
    [Agent APIs](/documentation/latest/operator-http-api) for attaching a remote
    client to the stdin, stdout, and stderr of a running Mesos task, as well as
    an API for launching new processes inside the same container as a running
    Mesos task and attaching to its stdin, stdout, and stderr. At a high level,
    these APIs mimic functionality similar to docker attach and docker exec.
    The primary motivation for such functionality is to enable users to debug
    their running Mesos tasks.

  * [MESOS-6758](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6758) -
    **Experimental** support for 'Basic' auth docker private registry
    on Mesos Containerizer. Until now, the mesos containerizer always assumed
    Bearer auth, but we now also support basic auth for private registries. Please
    note that the AWS ECS uses Basic authorization but it does not work yet due to
    the redirect issue [MESOS-5172](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5172).

More than 200 other bug fixes and improvements made it into this release. For full release notes with all features and bug fixes, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=mesos.git;a=blob_plain;f=CHANGELOG;hb=1.2.0).
