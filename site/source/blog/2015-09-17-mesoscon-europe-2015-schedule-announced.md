[MesosCon Europe 2015](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe) will take place in Dublin, Ireland in three weeks, and we’re excited to announce the event schedule and  availability of a diversity scholarship program.

## Schedule
The program committee was overwhelmed by the number of submissions to the first European edition of MesosCon — 65 talks and tutorials have been submitted, you all rock — [we turned to you](http://markmail.org/message/qf5dbzmugoh4gswf), the community to help us select the most interesting and relevant talks. Given we had hard constraints concerning time and space we ended up selecting 14 talks and four lightning talks based on your overall ranking.

The talks range from introductory presentations that aim helping the onboarding of new Mesos community members to deep dives: in the afternoon we will split into two tracks to be able to accommodate more topics. Sessions will take place on Thursday, October 8th 2015. Check out the [schedule](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe/program/schedule) yourself!

We'll also be holding a Mesos hackathon on Friday October 9th, and look forward to seeing what members of the community build and dream up.

## Diversity Scholarship Program
As important as the schedule might be, if you can’t be there in person, what gives? So, we're repeating the successful offering of a [scholarship program](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe/attend/scholarship): it provides support to women, people of color, and people with disabilities who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend MesosCon for financial reasons. [Apply](https://docs.google.com/a/twitter.com/forms/d/1YavIUe3-xjjmqxqpE_QYbBkDz3z72iada568NyPxRRg/viewform) today and hope to see you in Dublin.
