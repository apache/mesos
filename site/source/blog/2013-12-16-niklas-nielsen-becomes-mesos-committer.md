The Apache Mesos PMC has voted to make [Niklas Nielsen](http://mesosphere.io/2013/10/24/niklas-nielsen-joins-mesosphere/) the project's newest committer and PMC member. Niklas is an engineer at Engineer at [Mesosphere](http://mesosphere.io), and has a background in virtual machines, compilers and supercomputer tooling (distributed debuggers, profilers and so on).

Nielsen has particular interests in performance, scalability and tooling to give insights in otherwise fairly complex setups. Welcome, Niklas!
