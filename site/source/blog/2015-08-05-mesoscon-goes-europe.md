The Mesos [community](http://mesos.apache.org/community/) has been growing steadily over the past years and on behalf of the #MesosCon Program Committee Iâ€™m excited and proud to be able to share the great news with you: MesosCon is now a world-wide event and this fall it comes to Europe. Organized by the Apache Mesos community, [#MesosCon Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe) brings together users and developers to share and learn about the project and its growing ecosystem.

MesosCon Europe 2015 will take place in Dublin, Ireland and feature a full day of sessions to learn more about the Mesos core, an ecosystem developed around the project, and related technologies. The program will include workshops to get started with Mesos, keynote speakers from industry leaders, and sessions led by adopters and contributors. Day two will feature a hackathon held at the conference.

Now is a good time to start preparing yourself for #MesosCon Europe: no matter if you want to contribute through a talk submission (see the [CfP](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe/program/cfp) for details) or want to support us through a sponsorship. Stay tuned via [@MesosCon](http://twitter.com/mesoscon) and mark these dates in your calendar:

 * Early bird registration closes: 24 August 2015
 * CfP deadline: 25 August 2015
 * Schedule announced: 15 September 2015
 * Conference dates: 8 and 9 October 2015
