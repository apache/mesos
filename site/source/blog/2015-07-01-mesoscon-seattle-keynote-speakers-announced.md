MesosCon is an annual conference organized by the Apache Mesos community, bringing together users and developers to share and learn about the project and its growing ecosystem. [Register now](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon/attend/register) and join us in Seattle this August!

Here’s a rundown of several conference announcements:

## Keynote Speakers
We’ve curated a stellar line-up of invited keynote speakers, including:

 * Adrian Crockroft (Battery Ventures)
 * Benjamin Hindman (Mesosphere)
 * Neha Narula (MIT)
 * Peter Bailis (Berkeley)

You don’t want to miss these! We’ll also feature platinum sponsored keynotes from Cisco, Intel, and Mesosphere.

## Mesos Hackathon
The Mesos community will once again hold a day-long hackathon, this year on Wednesday, August 19th and sponsored by SignalFx. More details will be announced soon including the location and registration; stay tuned and hold the date!

## Lightning Talks
Want to present at MesosCon, but missed the call for full sessions? We’ve opened a [CFP for lightning talks](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon/program/lighting-talks); the application deadline is July 15th.

## Diversity Scholarship Program
The [MesosCon scholarship program](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon/attend/scholarship) provides support to women, people of color, and people with disabilities who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend MesosCon for financial reasons. Equal access and diversity are important to MesosCon, and we aim to remove this obstacle for underrepresented attendee groups. We want you at MesosCon, and we want to help you get there!
Applications are beginning to be reviewed, and will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Apply today! We also encourage MesosCon attendees to donate toward the diversity scholarship program directly during the time of registration using the online system.
## Stay In Touch
As we make future announcements about the conference, stay in the loop and help us get the word out! We’ll be tweeting from @ApacheMesos and @MesosCon, blogging on the [Apache Mesos blog](http://mesos.apache.org/blog/), and sharing updates on the project’s user@ mailing lists.
