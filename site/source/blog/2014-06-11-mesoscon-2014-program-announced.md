Today weâ€™re excited to announce the [program](http://mesoscon14.sched.org/) for [#MesosCon](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon) 2014, the first ever conference dedicated to the Mesos ecosystem. It will take place in Chicago August 21-22, 2014, and be co-located with [LinuxCon](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america) 2014. 

MesosCon welcomes attendees who are advanced users, along with those that are new to the project. There will be time to socialize, share and learn from adopters to core committers.  The first day will begin with an introductory *Mesos 101* workshop and keynote presentations from Mesos PMC lead Benjamin Hindman (Twitter) and John Wilkes (Google).  Day one will include single track talks featuring:

 * Mesos [frameworks](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/mesos-frameworks/): including [Apache Aurora](http://aurora.incubator.apache.org), [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon), [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark), and a stream processing framework developed by Netflix.
 * An operations perspective on Mesos: including talks on the challenges of running an elastic cluster, and using [Docker](http://www.docker.com) with Mesos.
 * Presentations from companies who use Mesos in production: including eBay, HubSpot, and Airbnb. These presenters will also participate in a panel discussion.

The final day will include a Mesos hackathon, generously sponsored by Atlassian. In advance of the hackathon, the community will seed ideas for specific features and projects to work on the [community mailing list](http://www.mail-archive.com/user@mesos.apache.org/).
