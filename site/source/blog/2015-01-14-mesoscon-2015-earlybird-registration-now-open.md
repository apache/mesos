A limited number of early-bird tickets are now available for [#MesosCon 2015](http://mesoscon.org), an annual conference organized by the Apache Mesos community. MesosCon brings together users and developers to share and learn about the project and its growing ecosystem, and will take place in Seattle, WA.

[Early-bird registration is open today](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon/attend/register) to the first 140 attendees / through February 14th, 2015.

MesosCon will take place August 20 - 21, 2015 at Sheraton Seattle in Seattle, WA. The cost of early-bird registration is US$299. The standard attendee registration fee will be US$399 (Through July 31, 2015), and late registration US$499 beginning August 1, 2015. Students are eligible for a special registration fee of US$99 (Note that a valid student id will be required at onsite check-in).

As part of the registration process, you'll have an opportunity to donate to a [Diversity Scholarship](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon/attend/scholarship) which has been established for the conference. MesosCon’s scholarship program provides support to women, people of color, and people with disabilities who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend MesosCon for financial reasons. Equal access and diversity are important to MesosCon, and we aim to remove this obstacle for underrepresented attendee groups. We encourage you to donate what you can! If you have any questions regarding the diversity scholarship, please contact [mesoscon-diversity@googlegroups.com](mailto:mesoscon-diversity@googlegroups.com).

On behalf of the #MesosCon Program Committee, we couldn’t be more excited about this year’s conference and what this means for the open source project’s community. We hope that you’ll join us!
