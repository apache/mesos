## Start Your Own MUG

It's easy. If you're interested in organizing a MUG in your city, share your interest on the user mailing list (user@mesos.apache.org) and we'll add you to our list. MUGs typically use Meetup.com or Twitter to coordinate. We encourage groups to be organized by at least two organizations, and share responsibility for hosting and organizing events.
