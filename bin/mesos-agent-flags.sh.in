# Add the JNI library so we can run JVM based executors without them
# needing to figure this out for themselves.
# NOTE: MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY is deprecated for use on JVM based
# frameworks, use MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY instead as that is
# the JNI specific library binding. Future releases of libmesos
# will not contain JNI bindings.
# TODO(tillt): Point MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY towards the JNI
# specific library once libmesos has been split.
