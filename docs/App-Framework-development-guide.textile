h1. App/Framework development guide

<b>Note:</b> In this document (and also in the Mesos code base, at least as of Feb 14, 2012), we refer to Mesos Applications as "Frameworks".

See one of the example framework schedulers in @MESOS_HOME/src/examples/@ to get an idea of what a Mesos framework scheduler and executor in the language of your choice looks like.

h2. Create your Framework Scheduler

You can write a framework scheduler in C, C++, Java/Scala, or Python. Your framework scheduler should inherit from the @Scheduler@ class (see API below). Your scheduler should create a SchedulerDriver (which will mediate communication between your scheduler and the Mesos master) and then call @SchedulerDriver.run()@

h3. Scheduler API (as of 2013/02/01) declared in @MESOS_HOME/include/mesos/scheduler.hpp@

   * master. A unique ID (generated by the master) used for
   * distinguishing this framework from others and MasterInfo
   * with the ip and port of the current master are provided as arguments.

h2. Create your Framework Executor

Your framework executor must inherit from the Executor class. It must override the launchTask() method. 
You can use the $MESOS_HOME environment variable inside of your executor to determine where mesos is running from.

<pre>
  /**
   * Invoked once the executor driver has been able to successfully
   * connect with Mesos. In particular, a scheduler can pass some
   * data to it's executors through the FrameworkInfo.ExecutorInfo's
   * data field.

                          const ExecutorInfo& executorInfo,
                          const FrameworkInfo& frameworkInfo,

</pre>


h2. Install your Framework

You need to put your framework somewhere that all slaves on the cluster can get it from. If you are running HDFS, you can put your executor into HDFS. Then, you tell Mesos where it is via the @ExecutorInfo@ parameter of @MesosSchedulerDriver@'s constructor (e.g. see src/examples/java/TestFramework.java for an example of this). ExecutorInfo is a a Protocol Buffer Message class (defined in @include/mesos/mesos.proto@), and you set its uri field to something like "HDFS://path/to/executor/". Also, you can pass the @frameworks_home@ configuration option (defaults to: @MESOS_HOME/frameworks@) to your @mesos-slave@ daemons when you launch them to specify where all of your framework executors are stored (e.g. on an NFS mount that is available to all slaves), then set @ExecutorInfo@ to be a relative path, and the slave will prepend the value of frameworks_home to the relative path provided.

Once you are sure that your executors are available to the mesos-slaves, you should be able to run your scheduler, which will register with the Mesos master, and start receiving resource offers!
