### USAGE ###
>        /redirect
>        /master/redirect

### TL;DR; ###
Redirects to the leading Master.

### DESCRIPTION ###
Returns 307 TEMPORARY_REDIRECT redirect to the leading master when
current master is not the leader.
Returns 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE if the leading master cannot be
found.

**NOTES:**
1. This is the recommended way to bookmark the WebUI when
running multiple Masters.
2. This is broken currently "on the cloud" (e.g. EC2) as
this will attempt to redirect to the private IP address, unless
advertise_ip points to an externally accessible IP
3. Any path after `/redirect` or `/master/redirect` will be appended to the protocol-relative redirect URL


### AUTHENTICATION ###
This endpoint does not require authentication.
