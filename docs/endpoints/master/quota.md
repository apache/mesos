Using this endpoint to set a quota for a certain role requires that
the current principal is authorized to set quota for the target role.
Similarly, removing quota requires that the principal is authorized
to remove quota created by the quota_principal.
Getting quota information for a certain role requires that the
current principal is authorized to get quota for the target role,
otherwise the entry for the target role could be silently filtered.
