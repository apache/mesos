# Containerizer

Containerizers are Mesos components responsible for launching
containers. They own the containers launched for the tasks/executors,
and are responsible for their isolation, resource management, and
events (e.g., statistics).

# Containerizer internals

### Containerizer creation and launch

* Agent creates a containerizer based on the flags (using agent flag
  `--containerizers`). If multiple containerizers (e.g., docker,
  mesos) are specified using the `--containerizers` flag, then the
  composing containerizer will be used to create a containerizer.
* If an executor is not specified in `TaskInfo`, Mesos agent will use
  the default executor for the task (depending on the Containerizer
  the agent is using, it could be `mesos-executor` or
  `mesos-docker-executor`). TODO: Update this after MESOS-1718 is
  completed. After this change, master will be responsible for
  generating executor information.

### Types of containerizers

Mesos currently supports the following containerizers:

* Composing
* [Docker](docker-containerizer.md)
* [Mesos](mesos-containerizer.md)

#### Composing Containerizer

Composing containerizer will compose the specified containerizers
(using agent flag `--containerizers`) and act like a single
containerizer. This is an implementation of the `composite` design
pattern.

#### Docker Containerizer

Docker containerizer manages containers using the docker engine provided
in the docker package.

##### Container launch

* Docker containerizer will attempt to launch the task in docker only
  if `ContainerInfo::type` is set to DOCKER.
* Docker containerizer will first pull the image.
* Calls pre-launch hook.
* The executor will be launched in one of the two ways:

A) Mesos agent runs in a docker container

* This is indicated by the presence of agent flag
  `--docker_mesos_image`. In this case, the value of flag
  `--docker_mesos_image` is assumed to be the docker image used to
  launch the Mesos agent.
* If the task includes an executor (custom executor), then that executor is
  launched in a docker container.
* If the task does not include an executor i.e. it defines a command, the
  default executor `mesos-docker-executor` is launched in a docker container to
  execute the command via Docker CLI.

B) Mesos agent does not run in a docker container

* If the task includes an executor (custom executor), then that executor is
  launched in a docker container.
* If task does not include an executor i.e. it defines a command, a subprocess
  is forked to execute the default executor `mesos-docker-executor`.
  `mesos-docker-executor` then spawns a shell to execute the command via Docker
  CLI.

#### Mesos Containerizer

Mesos containerizer is the native Mesos containerizer. Mesos
Containerizer will handle any executor/task that does not specify
`ContainerInfo::DockerInfo`.

##### Container launch

* Calls prepare on each isolator.
* Forks the executor using Launcher (see [Launcher](#Launcher)). The
  forked child is blocked from executing until it is been isolated.
* Isolate the executor. Call isolate with the pid for each isolator
  (see [Isolators](#Isolators)).
* Fetch the executor.
* Exec the executor. The forked child is signalled to continue. It
  will first execute any preparation commands from isolators and then
  exec the executor.

##### Launcher

Launcher is responsible for forking/destroying containers.

* Forks a new process in the containerized context. The child will
  exec the binary at the given path with the given argv, flags, and
  environment.
* The I/O of the child will be redirected according to the specified
  I/O descriptors.

###### Linux launcher

* Creates a "freezer" cgroup for the container.
* Creates posix "pipe" to enable communication between host (parent
  process) and container process.
* Spawn child process (container process) using `clone` system call.
* Moves the new container process to the freezer hierarchy.
* Signals the child process to continue (exec'ing) by writing a
  character to the write end of the pipe in the parent process.

###### Posix launcher (TBD)

<a name="Isolators"></a>
##### Isolators

Isolators are responsible for creating an environment for the
containers where resources like cpu, network, storage and memory can
be isolated from other containers.

### Containerizer states

#### Docker

* FETCHING
* PULLING
* RUNNING
* DESTROYING

#### Mesos

* PREPARING
* ISOLATING
* FETCHING
* RUNNING
* DESTROYING
