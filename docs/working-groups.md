# Working Groups

A working group is a group of people who are interested in actively participating in specific area of the project.
Below are some of the expectations from a working group:

* Should have at least one lead who is responsible for organizing and driving the work group meetings.
* Should have regular (online) meetings that are open to public, recorded and archived.
* Should maintain meeting notes that are shared with the <dev@mesos.apache.org> list regularly.
* Should have a corresponding slack channel (also publicly archived) where synchronous discussions take place.

## YouTube Channel

Past meetings should be posted to the [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0wxLxgX8ilUn0m31lCpzAw).

## Mailing List

Please use the <dev@mesos.apache.org> list for discussions.
We don't use separate mailing lists for each working group.
In order to distinguish emails for a specific working group, please tag the email subject with the working group name like the following:

    [XXX WG] YOUR SUBJECT HERE
