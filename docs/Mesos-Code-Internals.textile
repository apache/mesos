h1. Mesos Code Internals

h2. Top-level directories in the Mesos distribution

* ec2 - scripts for launching a Mesos cluster on EC2. See the wiki page on [[EC2-Scripts]]
* frameworks - Included Mesos Frameworks. See the READMEs in each one. See the [[App/Framework development guide]] for a crash course in how Mesos Frameworks get resources from the Mesos master.
* include - Contains headers that contain the interfaces that Mesos users need in order to interact with Mesos (e.g. the Mesos Framework API)
* src - Contains the entire Mesos source tree. See below for more details about the directories inside of @src@.
* third_party - Contains necessary open source third party software that Mesos leverages for things such as logging, etc.

h2. Mesos source code 

The Mesos source code (found in @MESOS_HOME/src@) is organized into the following hierarchy:

* common - shared source files (such as utilities and data structures)
* conf - where the mesos configuration file @mesos.conf@ lives
* config - 
* configurator - 
* deploy
* detector
* examples
* exec
* launcher
* local
* master - source files specific to the mesos-master daemon
* messaging
* scaling
* sched - source files specific to the mesos-slave daemon
* slave
* swig - WARNING: this might go away (at least for Java, as of the proto buffer commit, see issue #3
* tests
* webui
