# Software projects built on Mesos

## Long Running Services

* [Aurora](http://aurora.incubator.apache.org) is a service scheduler that runs on top of Mesos, enabling you to run long-running services that take advantage of Mesos' scalability, fault-tolerance, and resource isolation.
* [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) is a private PaaS built on Mesos. It automatically handles hardware or software failures and ensures that an app is "always on".
* [Singularity](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity) is a scheduler (HTTP API and web interface) for running Mesos tasks: long running processes, one-off tasks, and scheduled jobs.
* [SSSP](https://github.com/mesosphere/sssp) is a simple web application that provides a white-label "Megaupload" for storing and sharing files in S3.

## Big Data Processing

* [Cray Chapel](https://github.com/nqn/mesos-chapel) is a productive parallel programming language. The Chapel Mesos scheduler lets you run Chapel programs on Mesos.
* [Dpark](https://github.com/douban/dpark) is a Python clone of Spark, a MapReduce-like framework written in Python, running on Mesos.
* [Exelixi](https://github.com/mesosphere/exelixi) is a distributed framework for running genetic algorithms at scale.
* [Hadoop](https://github.com/mesos/hadoop) Running Hadoop on Mesos distributes MapReduce jobs efficiently across an entire cluster.
* [Hama](http://wiki.apache.org/hama/GettingStartedMesos) is a distributed computing framework based on Bulk Synchronous Parallel computing techniques for massive scientific computations e.g., matrix, graph and network algorithms.
* [MPI](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-hydra) is a message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computers.
* [Spark](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/) is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system which makes parallel jobs easy to write.
* [Storm](https://github.com/mesosphere/storm-mesos) is a distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing.

## Batch Scheduling

* [Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos) is a distributed job scheduler that supports complex job topologies. It can be used as a more fault-tolerant replacement for Cron.
* [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/mesos-plugin) is a continuous integration server. The mesos-jenkins plugin allows it to dynamically launch workers on a Mesos cluster depending on the workload.
* [JobServer](http://www.grandlogic.com/content/html_docs/jobserver.html) is a distributed job scheduler and processor  which allows developers to build custom batch processing Tasklets using point and click web UI.
* [Torque](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/running-torque-or-mpi-on-mesos/) is a distributed resource manager providing control over batch jobs and distributed compute nodes.


## Data Storage

* [Cassandra](https://github.com/mesosphere/cassandra-mesos) is a performant and highly available distributed database. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
* [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/mesosphere/elasticsearch-mesos) is a distributed search engine. Mesos makes it easy to run and scale.
* [Hypertable](https://code.google.com/p/hypertable/wiki/Mesos) is a high performance, scalable, distributed storage and processing system for structured and unstructured data.
