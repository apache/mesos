# External Containerizer


* EC = external containerizer. A part of the mesos slave that provides
an API for containerizing via external plugin executables.
* ECP = external containerizer program. An external plugin executable
implementing the actual containerizing by interfacing with a
containerizing system (e.g. Docker).

# Containerizing


# General Overview

EC invokes ECP as a shell process, passing the command as a parameter
to the ECP executable. Additional data is exhanged via stdin and
stdout.

The ECP is expected to return a zero exit code for all commands it was
able to process. A non-zero status code signals an error. Below you
will find an overview of the commands that have to be implemented by
an ECP, as well as their invocation scheme.

The ECP is expected to be using stderr for state info and displaying
additional debug information. That information is getting logged to
a file, see [Enviroment: **Sandbox**](#sandbox).


### Call and communication scheme

Interface describing the functions an ECP has to implement via
command calls. Many invocations on the ECP will also pass a
protobuf message along via stdin. Some invocations on the ECP also
expect to deliver a result protobuf message back via stdout.
All protobuf messages are prefixed by their original length -
this is sometimes referred to as "Record-IO"-format. See
[Record-IO De/Serializing Example](#record-io-deserializing-example).

**COMMAND < INPUT-PROTO > RESULT-PROTO**

* `launch < containerizer::Launch`
* `update < containerizer::Update`
* `usage < containerizer::Usage > mesos::ResourceStatistics`
* `wait < containerizer::Wait > containerizer::Termination`
* `destroy < containerizer::Destroy`
* `containers > containerizer::Containers`
* `recover`


# Command Ordering

## Make no assumptions
Commands may pretty much come in any order. There is only one
exception to this rule; when launching a task, the EC will make sure
that the ECP first receives a `launch` on that specific container, all
other commands are queued until `launch` returns from the ECP.


# Use Cases

## Task Launching EC / ECP Overview

* EC invokes `launch` on the ECP.
 * Along with that call, the ECP will receive a containerizer::Launch
 protobuf message via stdin.
 * ECP now makes sure the executor gets started.
**Note** that `launch` is not supposed to block. It should return
immediately after triggering the executor/command - that could be done
via fork-exec within the ECP.
* EC invokes `wait` on the ECP.
 * Along with that call, the ECP will receive a containerizer::Wait
 protobuf message via stdin.
 * ECP now blocks until the launched command is reaped - that could be
 implemented via waitpid within the ECP.
 * Once the command is reaped, the ECP should deliver a
 containerizer::Termination protobuf message via stdout, back to the
 EC.


## Container Lifecycle Sequence Diagrams


### Container Launching

A container is in a staging state and now gets started and observed
until it gets into a final state.

![Container Launching Scheme](../images/ec_launch_seqdiag.png?raw=true)

### Container Running

A container has gotten launched at some point and now is considered
being in a non terminal state by the slave. The following commands
will get triggered multiple times at the ECP over the lifetime of a
container. Their order however is not determined.

![Container Running Scheme](../images/ec_lifecycle_seqdiag.png?raw=true)

### Resource Limitation

While a container is active, a resource limitation was identified
(e.g. out of memory) by the ECP isolation mechanism of choice.

![Resource Limitation Scheme](../images/ec_kill_seqdiag.png?raw=true)

## Slave Recovery Overview

* Slave recovers via check pointed state.
* EC invokes `recover` on the ECP - there is no protobuf message sent
or expected as a result from this command.
 * The ECP may try to recover internal states via its own failover
mechanisms, if needed.
* After `recover` returns, the EC will invoke `containers` on the ECP.
 * The ECP should return Containers which is a list of currently
 active containers.
**Note** these containers are known to the ECP but might in fact
partially be unknown to the slave (e.g. slave failed after launch but
before or within wait) - those containers are considered to be
orphans.
* The EC now compares the list of slave known containers to those
listed within `Containers`. For each orphan it identifies, the slave
will invoke a `wait` followed by a `destroy` on the ECP for those
containers.
* Slave will now call `wait` on the ECP (via EC) for all recovered
containers. This does once again put `wait` into the position of the
ultimate command reaper.


## Slave Recovery Sequence Diagram

### Recovery

While containers are active, the slave fails over.

![Recovery Scheme](../images/ec_recover_seqdiag.png?raw=true)

### Orphan Destruction

Containers identified by the ECP as being active but not slave state
recoverable are getting terminated.

![Orphan Destruction Scheme](../images/ec_orphan_seqdiag.png?raw=true)


# Command Details

## launch
### Start the containerized executor

Hands over all information the ECP needs for launching a task
via an executor.
This call should not wait for the executor/command to return. The
actual reaping of the containerized command is done via the `wait`
call.

    launch < containerizer::Launch

This call receives the containerizer::Launch protobuf via stdin.

    /**
     * Encodes the launch command sent to the external containerizer
     * program.
     */
    message Launch {
      required ContainerID container_id = 1;
      optional TaskInfo task_info = 2;
      optional ExecutorInfo executor_info = 3;
      optional string directory = 4;
      optional string user = 5;
      optional SlaveID slave_id = 6;
      optional string slave_pid = 7;
      optional bool checkpoint = 8;
    }

This call does not return any data via stdout.

## wait
### Gets information on the containerized executor's Termination

Is expected to reap the executor/command. This call should block
until the executor/command has terminated.

    wait < containerizer::Wait > containerizer::Termination

This call receives the containerizer::Wait protobuf via stdin.

    /**
     * Encodes the wait command sent to the external containerizer
     * program.
     */
    message Wait {
      required ContainerID container_id = 1;
    }

This call is expected to return containerizer::Termination via stdout.

    /**
     * Information about a container termination, returned by the
     * containerizer to the slave.
     */
    message Termination {
      // A container may be killed if it exceeds its resources; this will
      // be indicated by killed=true and described by the message string.
      required bool killed = 1;
      required string message = 2;

      // Exit status of the process.
      optional int32 status = 3;
    }

The Termination attribute `killed` is to be set only when the
containerizer or the underlying isolation had to enforce a limitation
by killing the task (e.g. task exceeded suggested memory limit).

## update
### Updates the container's resource limits

Is sending (new) resource constraints for the given container.
Resource constraints onto a container may vary over the lifetime of
the containerized task.

    update < containerizer::Update

This call receives the containerizer::Update protobuf via stdin.

    /**
     * Encodes the update command sent to the external containerizer
     * program.
     */
    message Update {
      required ContainerID container_id = 1;
      repeated Resource resources = 2;
    }

This call does not return any data via stdout.

## usage
### Gathers resource usage statistics for a containerized task
Is used for polling the current resource uses for the given container.

    usage < containerizer::Usage > mesos::ResourceStatistics

This call received the containerizer::Usage protobuf via stdin.

    /**
     * Encodes the usage command sent to the external containerizer
     * program.
     */
    message Usage {
      required ContainerID container_id = 1;
    }

This call is expected to return mesos::ResourceStatistics via stdout.

    /*
     * A snapshot of resource usage statistics.
     */
    message ResourceStatistics {
      required double timestamp = 1; // Snapshot time, in seconds since the Epoch.

      // CPU Usage Information:
      // Total CPU time spent in user mode, and kernel mode.
      optional double cpus_user_time_secs = 2;
      optional double cpus_system_time_secs = 3;

      // Number of CPUs allocated.
      optional double cpus_limit = 4;

      // cpu.stat on process throttling (for contention issues).
      optional uint32 cpus_nr_periods = 7;
      optional uint32 cpus_nr_throttled = 8;
      optional double cpus_throttled_time_secs = 9;

      // Memory Usage Information:
      optional uint64 mem_rss_bytes = 5; // Resident Set Size.

      // Amount of memory resources allocated.
      optional uint64 mem_limit_bytes = 6;

      // Broken out memory usage information (files, anonymous, and mmaped files)
      optional uint64 mem_file_bytes = 10;
      optional uint64 mem_anon_bytes = 11;
      optional uint64 mem_mapped_file_bytes = 12;
    }

## destroy
### Terminates the containerized executor

Is used in rare situations, like for graceful slave shutdown
but also in slave fail over scenarios - see Slave Recovery for more.

    destroy < containerizer::Destroy

This call receives the containerizer::Destroy protobuf via stdin.

    /**
     * Encodes the destroy command sent to the external containerizer
     * program.
     */
    message Destroy {
      required ContainerID container_id = 1;
    }

This call does not return any data via stdout.

## containers
### Gets all active container-id's

Returns all container identifiers known to be currently active.

    containers > containerizer::Containers

This call does not receive any additional data via stdin.

This call is expected to pass containerizer::Containers back via
stdout.

    /**
     * Information on all active containers returned by the containerizer
     * to the slave.
     */
    message Containers {
      repeated ContainerID containers = 1;
    }


## recover
### Internal ECP state recovery

Allows the ECP to do a state recovery on its own. If the ECP
uses state check-pointing e.g. via file system, then this call would
be a good moment to de-serialize that state information. Make sure you
also see [Slave Recovery Overview](#slave-recovery-overview) for more.

    recover

This call does not receive any additional data via stdin.
No returned data via stdout.



### Protobuf Message Definitions

For possibly more up-to-date versions of the above mentioned protobufs
as well as protobuf messages referenced by them, please check:

* containerizer::XXX are defined within
  include/mesos/containerizer/containerizer.proto.

* mesos::XXX are defined within include/mesos/mesos.proto.



# Environment

## **Sandbox**

A sandbox environment is formed by `cd` into the work-directory of the
executor as well as a stderr redirect into the executor's "stderr"
log-file.
**Note** not **all** invocations have a complete sandbox environment.


## Addional Environment Variables

Additionally, there are a few new environment variables set when
invoking the ECP.


* MESOS_LIBEXEC_DIRECTORY = path to mesos-executor, mesos-usage, ...
This information is always present.

* MESOS_WORK_DIRECTORY = slave work directory. This should be used for
distinguishing slave instances.
This information is always present.

**Note** that this is specifically helpful for being able to tie a set
of containers to a specific slave instance, thus allowing proper
recovery when needed.

* MESOS_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_IMAGE = default image as provided via slave
flags (default_container_image). This variable is provided only in
calls to `launch`.



# Debugging

## Enhanced Verbosity Logging

For receiving an increased level of status information from the EC
use the GLOG verbosity level. Prefix your mesos startup call by
setting the level to a value higher than or equal to two.

`GLOG_v=2 ./bin/mesos-slave --master=[...]`


## ECP stderr Logging

All output to stderr of your ECP will get logged to the executor's
'stderr' log file.
The specific location can be extracted from the [Enhanced Verbosity
Logging](#enhanced-verbosity-logging) of the EC.

Example Log Output:

# Appendix

## Record-IO Proto Example: Launch

This is what a properly record-io formatted protobuf looks like.

**name:    offset**

* length: 00 - 03 = record length in byte

* payload: 04 - (length + 4) = protobuf payload

Example length: 00000240h = 576 byte total protobuf size
