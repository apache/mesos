* [Persistent Volume](persistent-volume.md) for how to allow tasks to access persistent storage resources.
* [Multiple Disks](multiple-disk.md) for how to to allow tasks to use multiple isolated disk resources.
* [Quota](quota.md) for how to configure Mesos to provide guaranteed resource allocations for use by a role.
* [Reservation](reservation.md) for how operators and frameworks can reserve resources on individual agents for use by a role.
* [Replicated Log](replicated-log-internals.md) for information on the Mesos replicated log.
