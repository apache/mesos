# FIND_PACKAGE_HELPER is a convenience function that is intended for use
# in conjunction with the `find_package` CMake command.  Our usage of
# `find_package(<package>)` will search for files named `Find<package>.cmake`
# in our configured CMake include directories and load those files as modules.
#
# The `Find<package>.cmake` files should call this helper function only after
# defining a set of variables:
#   * POSSIBLE_${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS
#     A list of possible locations to find the `HEADER_FILE`.
#   * POSSIBLE_${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_DIRS
#     A list of possible locations to find the libraries (below).
#   * ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIBRARY_NAMES
#     A list of all the library names to search for.
#
# Upon returning, this function will set the following variables in
# the caller's scope:
#   * ${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIR - Defines where to find header files.
#   * ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIBS        - Defines the name of library files.
