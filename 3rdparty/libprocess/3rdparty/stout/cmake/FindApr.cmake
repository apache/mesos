# This module helps to find the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and APR-Util
# packages.
#
# USAGE: to use this module, add the following line to your CMake project:
#   find_package(Apr)
#
# To make linking to APR simple, this module defines:
#   * APR_FOUND and APRUTIL_FOUND             (if false, linking build will fail)
#   * APR_INCLUDE_DIR and APRUTIL_INCLUDE_DIR (defineswhere to find apr.h, etc.)
#   * APR_LIBS and APRUTIL_LIBS     (binaries for APR and friends)
#
# Also defined, but not for general use are:
#   * APR_LIB and APRUTIL_LIB         (where to find the APR library)

# CONFIGURE THE APR SEARCH. Specify what we're looking for, and which directories
# we're going to look through to find them.
