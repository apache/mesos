# This file exports variables needed to link to third-party libs. These are
# used throughout the Mesos project.
#
# This includes things like:
#   * Components defining the public interface, like which headers we need in
#     order to link to libprocess.
#   * Where to look to find built libraries.
#   * Version information of the third-party libraries in use.
#
# This does not include:
#   * Where to find include headers for tests -- the rest of Mesos does not
#     need this information.
#   * Any information about how to build these libraries. That's in
#     libprocess/CMakeLists.txt
#   * Information required to build third-party libraries, wuch as what source
#     files we need to compile libprocess.
#   * Build commands actually used to compile (e.g.) libprocess.
#
# Rationale: Autoconf makes linking to third party dependencies as simple as
# pointing at the underlying makefile. In CMake, this is harder because we do
# not assume there are Makefiles at all. Thus, it is useful to export variables
# with things like which header files you need to include to link to third
# party libraries, and where in the directory tree you need to look to get the
# actual libraries.
