# Defines the variables useful for tests, and exports them to the scope of
# whatever file includes this file. There are a few important consequence of this:
#
#   * This file MUST be included before the third-party dependencies like gmock
#     are configured/built/downloaded (if you're doing this). If this code isn't
#     run first, then we won't know (e.g.) what folders to unpack the code to.
#   * This file ONLY defines and exports variables for third-party dependencies
#     that are required by the test suite, but are not a dependency that
#     libprocess core takes. That is, this file handles the gmock dependency,
#     but not the glog dependency (which the process library itself takes a
#     dependency on).
#   * This file and the config file for the libprocess "core" dependencies (e.g.,
#     glog, boost, etc.) so that we can export the variables for the core
#     dependencies (e.g., where to find the .so/.dll files) without having to also
#     export the variables for the dependencies that only the test package has.

# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE FOR THIRD-PARTY LIBS REQUIRED FOR TEST INFRASTRUCTURE.
